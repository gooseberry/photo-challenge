In the month of April of this year.  We'll have a simple photoshoot challenge between friends as a fun way to push our skills in photography and hopefully
learn some new skills and improve on our existing skills.  

The rules for this challenge is pretty simple.  Eveyday, each challenger must submit a photo that follows one of the themes outlined below.
Photos submitted for this challenge must be related to the theme, but are not limited to a single theme.  For instance, you can tag a photo as being a photo
of a kitten and a photo of something you fear!  There are no prizes for this so it doesn't really matter if you follow the rules or not.

To make the submissions more fun, challengers are encouraged to submit stories, true or fictional, that go along with their photos.  The point of these stories
is to make the photos more interesting or entertaining.

...enjoy
